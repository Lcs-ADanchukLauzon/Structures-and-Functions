 # Introduction
 
 Functions are useful because they help us:
 
 * implement an abstract rule (i.e.: draw an n-sided regular polygon)
 * better organize our code by making it more readable
 * make code easier to maintain (this is called **refactoring** our code)
 
 This playground will recap how basic functions work, how functions that return values work, and how **structures** can make our functions even more useful.
 
 Ready? Let's begin.
