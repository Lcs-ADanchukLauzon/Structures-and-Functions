 ## Functions
 ### Functions with no return values
 Functions do not always need to return a value.
 
 Sometimes it is helpful just to *encapsulate* some behaviour inside a function to make code more readable.
 
 Say we want to greet a person. We could define the following function:
 
 ![example](example.png "example")
 
 Type the code that you see above. Then run the playground to try it out.
